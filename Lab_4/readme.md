Raster Graphics App
Description
This application, built with Python using the Tkinter library, is designed to demonstrate various raster algorithms, including DDA, Bresenham's line and circle algorithms, and a step-by-step method. Users can select an algorithm, input starting and ending points, and visualize the results on a coordinate grid.

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the Tkinter library if it's not already included (usually bundled with the standard Python library).
Download or clone the repository containing the application code.
Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash

Copy
python raster_graphics_app.py
Usage
Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Enter the starting point (x1, y1).
Enter the ending point (x2, y2) for lines, or the radius for circles.
Click the "Build" button to visualize the result.
The execution time will be displayed below the canvas.
Features
Algorithms Supported:
DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)
Bresenham's Line Algorithm
Bresenham's Circle Algorithm
